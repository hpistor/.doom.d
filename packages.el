;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here, run 'doom sync' on
;; the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect.
;; Alternatively, use M-x doom/reload.
;;
;; WARNING: Disabling core packages listed in ~/.emacs.d/core/packages.el may
;; have nasty side-effects and is not recommended.


;; All of Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit, and updated from
;; release to release. To un-pin all packages and live on the edge, do:
;(unpin! t)

;; ...but to unpin a single package:
;(unpin! pinned-package)
;; Use it to unpin multiple packages
;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)


;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a particular repo, you'll need to specify
;; a `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;(package! another-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;(package! this-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

(package! direnv
  :recipe (:host github :repo "wbolster/emacs-direnv"))

(package! ox-gfm
  :recipe (:host github :repo "larstvei/ox-gfm"))

(package! org-roam
  :recipe (:host github :repo "jethrokuan/org-roam"))
